### KadCity

[Kaduna Capital Territory Authority (K.C.T.A.)](https://gada-studios.vercel.app/work/kadcity-app) app is an effort spearheaded by one of Kaduna state's mayors to engage Kaduna state inhabitants in the state's development. It aims to bridge the gap between the government and its citizens by viewing the city through their eyes.

Its purpose is to develop a brand identity that connects with people and embodies the spirit of the company. A basic, out-of-the-box, yet stylish and edgy design that expresses creativity and conveys a message to the people of Kaduna state.

### Xanda Farms

[Xanda Farms](https://gada-studios.vercel.app/work/xanda-farms) is a livestock and agricultural farming Agric-business. It aspires to be Nigeria's leading distributor of agricultural products and animals. For starters, it is mostly concerned with dairy farming.

The brand identity's purpose is to express the essence of what Xanda Farms is. A logo design that conveys and carries the brand's values and long-term aspirations.

### DCSEL - Rebrand

The new brand identity's purpose is to express the firm's basic principles and goals. I came up with concepts that are in keeping with those ideals by preserving the brand's present color palette.

### Guest 365

Recognizing the rising demand in the hotel sector since the COVID19 epidemic began, [Guest365](https://gada-studios.vercel.app/work/guest-365) was created based on our knowledge and awareness of the issues associated with running a hospitality business and providing visitor pleasure.

The brand identity's purpose was to capture the essence of what Guest365 is. A hospitality platform that prioritizes guests. The logo design aims to convey high-quality experiences.
